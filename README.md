# IN PROGRESS Clean Architecture with Koa, Typescript, TypeOrm, Inversify
This project is a template made to learn about Clean Architecture and the stack mentioned above.
It will be updated as serious projects begin to implement new functionality based on this template.
    
## To use it:

`yarn or npm install`

Then

`yarn dev or npm run dev`

You also need to modifiy ormconfig.sample.json with your database configuration (MySQL for me).

## TODO:

+ [ ] Make basic tests, probably with Jest to learn about testing.

+ [ ] Proper handling of configuration (Dev vs Production).

+ [ ] Proper logging.

+ [ ] Learn about Koa security best practices and implement it.
